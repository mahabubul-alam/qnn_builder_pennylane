### QNN Builder (Pennylane)
You can build QNN models with various encoding methods, parametric layer architectures, and measurement operations using the python scripts in this repository. Supports for more encoding methods/parametric layers/measurements will be added in the future. For currently supported method, please refer to:
* https://github.com/mahabubul-alam/qnn_builder_pennylane/blob/main/app/encoding_circuits.py
* https://github.com/mahabubul-alam/qnn_builder_pennylane/blob/main/app/parametric_circuits.py
